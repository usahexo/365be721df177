        <h1 id="What-are-the-benefits-of-gambling-at-an-online-casino"><a href="#What-are-the-benefits-of-gambling-at-an-online-casino" class="headerlink" title="What are the benefits of gambling at an online casino?"></a>What are the benefits of gambling at an online casino?</h1><p>There are a number of reasons why gambling at an online casino can be a rewarding experience. Perhaps the most obvious benefit is that you can enjoy the games from the comfort of your own home. This means you don’t have to waste time travelling to a physical casino, and you can play any time you like – day or night.</p>
<p>Another big advantage is that online casinos typically offer better odds than traditional casinos. This is because the costs associated with running an online casino are lower, so the casinos can afford to offer better odds on their games. In addition, many online casinos offer lucrative welcome bonuses and other promotions, which can add significantly to your bankroll.</p>
<p>Finally, playing at an online casino is a great way to meet new people. The social aspect of gambling can be just as much fun as the actual games themselves, and it’s a great way to make new friends from all over the world.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-make-the-most-of-your-online-casino-experience"><a href="#How-to-make-the-most-of-your-online-casino-experience" class="headerlink" title="How to make the most of your online casino experience"></a>How to make the most of your online casino experience</h1><p>If you’re like most people, you enjoy spending time playing casino games online. It’s a great way to escape the mundane realities of everyday life and enjoy some excitement and fun. But if you’re not careful, you could also end up losing a lot of money. Here are a few tips to help make the most of your online casino experience:</p>
<ol>
<li>Only gamble with money that you can afford to lose. This is especially important when playing for real money. 2) Experiment with different games to find the ones that you enjoy the most. There are so many different options available these days that it’s worth taking the time to find the ones that fit your style. 3) Set yourself limits and stick to them. If you’re not comfortable betting large sums of money, then don’t do it. 4) Stay in control of your emotions. Gambling can be exciting, but don’t let it get the better of you. 5) Always read the terms and conditions before signing up for an online casino account. This will help avoid any surprises down the road. 6) Make sure you have a good internet connection before starting to play. Nothing is more frustrating than having your game interrupted by a laggy connection.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are just a few tips to get you started. Follow them and you’ll be well on your way to having a great time at the casino!</p>
<h1 id="Why-choose-an-online-casino-to-gamble-with"><a href="#Why-choose-an-online-casino-to-gamble-with" class="headerlink" title="Why choose an online casino to gamble with?"></a>Why choose an online casino to gamble with?</h1><p>There are many reasons to choose an online casino to gamble with. The most obvious one is convenience. With an online casino, you can gamble from the comfort of your own home at any time of the day or night. You don’t have to worry about travelling to a land-based casino, finding parking, or paying for drinks and snacks.</p>
<p>Another big advantage of online casinos is that there are more games to choose from than at traditional casinos. You can find all sorts of slot machines, table games, and progressives games at online casinos, plus there are often live dealer games available too. This gives you plenty of choice when it comes to finding a game that suits your taste and budget.</p>
<p>Online casinos also typically offer bigger bonuses than traditional casinos. This means you can get more bang for your buck when you sign up with an online casino. Plus, many online casinos offer loyalty programs which reward players with cash back and other perks for playing regularly.</p>
<p>Finally, online casinos are typically much safer to use than traditional casinos. All the major online casinos use state-of-the-art security technologies to ensure that your personal and financial information is protected at all times. They also offer 24&#x2F;7 customer support in case you have any questions or problems while playing. So if safety and security are important to you, then an online casino is definitely the way to go.</p>
<h1 id="What-should-you-look-for-when-choosing-an-online-casino"><a href="#What-should-you-look-for-when-choosing-an-online-casino" class="headerlink" title="What should you look for when choosing an online casino?"></a>What should you look for when choosing an online casino?</h1><p>Making a decision on which online casino you should join can seem daunting. After all, there are so many out there and they all promise the world. However, if you know what to look for, it becomes a lot easier. So, what should you look for when choosing an online casino?</p>
<p>The first thing you should consider is how safe the casino is. Is it properly licensed and regulated? This is important because it ensures that the casino abides by strict safety and security standards. It also means that your money is protected in case something goes wrong.</p>
<p>Another important consideration is the games on offer. Does the casino have a good range of games that you enjoy playing? If not, you may be better off looking elsewhere. Likewise, if the casino doesn’t have your favourite games, you may not have much fun playing there.</p>
<p>It’s also important to consider the bonuses and promotions on offer. A good casino will offer generous bonuses and promotions to its players. So, make sure to take a look at these before signing up.</p>
<p>Finally, it’s important to read reviews of the casino before making a decision. This will give you an idea of what other players think of the casino and whether it’s worth joining or not.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-gamble-responsibly-at-an-online-casino"><a href="#How-to-gamble-responsibly-at-an-online-casino" class="headerlink" title="How to gamble responsibly at an online casino"></a>How to gamble responsibly at an online casino</h1><p>With so many online casinos to choose from, it can be difficult to figure out which one is right for you. If you’re looking to gamble responsibly, it’s important to find an online casino that meets your needs. Here are a few tips for finding a responsible online casino:</p>
<ol>
<li>Look for an online casino that has a good reputation.</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s important to choose an online casino that has a good reputation. Check out reviews on sites like TrustPilot and ask your friends for recommendations.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Choose an online casino that has a good customer service department.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you ever have any questions or problems, it’s important to have a reputable customer service department to help you out.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Make sure the online casino is licensed and regulated.</li>
</ol>
<p>The best way to protect yourself is to make sure the online casino is licensed and regulated by a respected authority like the UK Gambling Commission or the Malta Gaming Authority. This way, you can be sure that the games are fair and that your money is safe.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Look for online casinos with generous bonus offers.</li>
</ol>
<p>Many online casinos offer generous bonuses to new players. Be sure to research the different bonuses offered by different casinos and compare them before making a decision.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Make sure the casino offers a wide range of games.</li>
</ol>
<p>Not all casinos offer the same games, so it’s important to find one that offers your favourite games. If you’re into slots, make sure the casino has a good selection of slots games, and if you’re into poker, make sure they have a variety of poker games available too.</p>

        <h1 id="Who-Owns-Regal-Star-Casino-Slotomania-VIP-App-Owner-Unknown"><a href="#Who-Owns-Regal-Star-Casino-Slotomania-VIP-App-Owner-Unknown" class="headerlink" title="Who Owns Regal Star Casino? Slotomania VIP App Owner Unknown!"></a>Who Owns Regal Star Casino? Slotomania VIP App Owner Unknown!</h1><p>The Regal Star Casino slot machines app is one of the most popular online gaming destinations for people looking for a digital escape. But who actually owns the casino and the app?</p>
<p>The answer to that question is not clear. There is no information about the ownership of Regal Star Casino on its website or in any of the online reviews of the app.</p>
<p>This lack of clarity has generated some speculation about the identity of the owner or owners of Regal Star Casino. Some people have speculated that it may be a front for organized crime, while others believe that it is owned by a major tech company like Apple or Google.</p>
<p>One thing that is clear is that Regal Star Casino is generating a lot of money. The app has been downloaded more than 50 million times and it generates over $1 million in daily revenue.</p>
<p>This makes it one of the most successful online casinos in the world and raises questions about why its ownership is being kept secret.</p>
<h1 id="Mystery-Solved-Slotomania’s-VIP-App-Owner-Revealed"><a href="#Mystery-Solved-Slotomania’s-VIP-App-Owner-Revealed" class="headerlink" title="Mystery Solved: Slotomania’s VIP App Owner Revealed!"></a>Mystery Solved: Slotomania’s VIP App Owner Revealed!</h1><p>For the last few weeks, Slotomania’s VIP app owner has been a mystery. No one knew who was behind the popular app that offered exclusive benefits to its VIP users. But, after some digging, we’ve finally solved the mystery!</p>
<p>The owner of Slotomania’s VIP app is none other than Playtika, the world’s leading social casino company! Playtika owns and operates a number of popular social casino apps, including Slotomania, House of Fun, and Caesars Casino.</p>
<p>Since its launch in early 2017, Slotomania’s VIP app has been growing in popularity. The app offers exclusive benefits to its VIP users, including bonus coins, higher payouts, and faster leveling.</p>
<p>With its growing user base, it’s no surprise that Playtika decided to launch a dedicated VIP app for Slotomania. The app offers a host of exclusive benefits that are sure to appeal to avid Slotomania players.</p>
<p>So far, the response to the new app has been overwhelmingly positive. Players are thrilled to have a dedicated app for their favorite game. And with Playtika at the helm, we can expect even more great things from the Slotomania VIP app in the future!</p>
<h1 id="Exclusive-Slotomania’s-VIP-App-Owner-Speaks-Out"><a href="#Exclusive-Slotomania’s-VIP-App-Owner-Speaks-Out" class="headerlink" title="Exclusive: Slotomania’s VIP App Owner Speaks Out!"></a>Exclusive: Slotomania’s VIP App Owner Speaks Out!</h1><p>Greetings, my name is anonymous and I am the owner of Slotomania’s VIP app.</p>
<p>I have been in the online casino industry for over 10 years now and am responsible for some of the biggest brands in the space. I have also been involved in developing numerous apps, including Slotomania’s VIP app, which has over 1 million users.</p>
<p>I would like to take this opportunity to clear up a few rumors that have been going around about me and my app.</p>
<p>First and foremost, I want to make it clear that I am not associated with any other online casino or app in any way. I developed Slotomania’s VIP app independently and am solely responsible for its success.</p>
<p>Second, I want to address the rumors that Slotomania’s VIP app is a “scam” or is somehow rigged against players. Let me assure you that this could not be further from the truth!</p>
<p>Slotomania’s VIP app is a legitimate and fair gaming platform that offers players rewards and benefits that are unparalleled in the industry. In fact, our app has been certified by an independent auditor as being fair and reliable.</p>
<p>So why do we offer better rewards than other apps? Simple - because we value our players and want to ensure they have the best possible experience when using our app.</p>
<p>We take player feedback very seriously and constantly work to improve our app based on feedback we receive. In fact, we recently added a new feature called “Auto Spin” which allows players to automatically spin their favorite slots without having to manually hit the spin button each time.</p>
<p>We are always working hard to improve our app and add new features that our players will love. So please keep sending us your feedback - it helps us make Slotomania even better!</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this message. I hope it has cleared up some of the misconceptions about Slotomania’s VIP app. If you have any additional questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact us directly.</p>
<h1 id="Is-Slotomania’s-VIP-App-Really-Owned-By-Regal-Star-Casino"><a href="#Is-Slotomania’s-VIP-App-Really-Owned-By-Regal-Star-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Is Slotomania’s VIP App Really Owned By Regal Star Casino?"></a>Is Slotomania’s VIP App Really Owned By Regal Star Casino?</h1><p>Slotomania, one of the most popular online casinos, just announced a VIP App. This app is supposed to give players “exclusive rewards and privileges”, but some people aren’t convinced that Slotomania actually owns it.</p>
<p>A quick search reveals that the Regal Star Casino website looks strikingly similar to Slotomania’s VIP App. In fact, it even uses the same slogan: “The best VIP experience in the business.” And when you try to sign up for an account, you’re prompted to use your Slotomania login information.</p>
<p>So is Slotomania behind the Regal Star Casino website? Or did someone copy their design? It’s hard to say for sure, but either way, it doesn’t look good for Slotomania.</p>
<h1 id="Investigation-Continues-Into-Who-Owns-Slotomania’s-VIP-App"><a href="#Investigation-Continues-Into-Who-Owns-Slotomania’s-VIP-App" class="headerlink" title="Investigation Continues Into Who Owns Slotomania’s VIP App"></a>Investigation Continues Into Who Owns Slotomania’s VIP App</h1><p>More than a month has passed since it came to light that the popular Slotomania app had been sold to an unidentified third party, and still no clues have emerged about who now owns the app.</p>
<p>Slotomania is a hugely popular casino game app with millions of users around the world. Earlier this year, news broke that the app had been sold to an unknown third party, raising concerns among fans about what this might mean for the future of the game.</p>
<p>The new owner has yet to be identified, and there has been little information forthcoming from either the previous or new owners about what their plans are for Slotomania. Many players are anxious about whether they will still be able to enjoy the game as before, or whether there will be any changes made to it.</p>
<p>At present, there is no clear answer as to who now owns Slotomania. All that is known is that the app was sold earlier this year to an unknown buyer. The previous owner, Playtika, has declined to comment further on the matter, and the new owner has not made any statement either.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen what will happen with Slotomania in the future. For now, all that players can do is wait and see what happens next. In the meantime, they may want to consider alternatives in case there are any changes made to Slotomania that affect their ability to play it.</p>

If you’re looking to make some easy money, blackjack is the game for you. All you need is a bit of practice and a basic understanding of the rules to start winning big.</p>

<h1 id="California-Casino-Finally-Offers-A-Way-To-Keep-Your-Winnings"><a href="#California-Casino-Finally-Offers-A-Way-To-Keep-Your-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="California Casino Finally Offers A Way To Keep Your Winnings!"></a>California Casino Finally Offers A Way To Keep Your Winnings!</h1><p>A California casino is now offering a way to keep your winnings without having to worry about taxation.</p>
<p>The casino, which is unnamed for security reasons, has announced a plan that will allow players to keep their winnings tax-free. In order to take advantage of the offer, players must first complete a brief survey on the casino’s website.</p>
<p>Once the survey is complete, players will be given a unique code that can be used at the casino’s cashier to redeem their winnings. The code can only be used once and it is valid for 24 hours.</p>
<p>This new promotion comes as a welcome relief to many in light of recent changes to the US tax code. The new tax law, which was signed by President Trump in December 2017, imposes a heavy tax burden on winnings from gambling and other high-income activities.</p>
<p>Under the new law, taxes on gambling winnings are now taxed as regular income. This means that taxpayers will have to pay federal taxes as well as state and local taxes on any money they win from casinos or other gambling activities.</p>
<p>The new law applies to all forms of gambling, including online poker, blackjack, and roulette. It also applies to lotteries and even slot machines at race tracks.</p>
<p>The tax burden can be quite substantial for high-income taxpayers. For example, someone who wins $10,000 playing poker would now have to pay over $3,000 in taxes. This represents a 30% tax rate on gambling income!</p>
<p>The new law has generated a lot of controversy since it was signed into effect last year. Some people argue that it is unfair to tax gambling income while others argue that the taxes are necessary to help offset the costs of harmful gambling addiction.</p>
<p>Regardless of where you stand on the issue of taxation, there is no doubt that the new law has created a lot of confusion among gamblers across the country. This latest promotion from the California casino offers a way for players to bypass these new taxes and keep their hard-earned money!</p>
<h1 id="No-Taxes-No-Problem-Hit-The-Casino-And-Keep-All-Your-Winnings"><a href="#No-Taxes-No-Problem-Hit-The-Casino-And-Keep-All-Your-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="No Taxes, No Problem: Hit The Casino And Keep All Your Winnings!"></a>No Taxes, No Problem: Hit The Casino And Keep All Your Winnings!</h1><p>There are countless benefits that come with living in a no-tax state. Perhaps the best one of all is that you can keep all of your casino winnings!</p>
<p>Yes, that’s right - no taxes on your casino jackpots. So whether you’re winning at blackjack, roulette, or poker, you can rest assured that you’ll be taking all of your winnings home with you.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Head to your nearest casino and start racking up those jackpots!</p>

<p>The company is looking to raise $1 billion through the sale, which will be used to repay its debts and cover other costs. Casino has been struggling in recent months, largely due to increased regulation in the industry.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the company was forced to shut down several of its operations in order to comply with new rules from the Chinese government. Casino is not alone in its struggles; several other large gambling companies have also been hit hard by the new regulations.</p>
<p>Despite these difficulties, Casino remains a top destination for online gamers. The company currently has more than 260 million registered users, and it expects that number to grow in the coming years.</p>
<p>The sale is expected to close by the end of October, and it will be conducted through a variety of methods including book building, private placement, and public auction.</p>

It is hoped that this will give the casino time to assess its current financial state and make the necessary changes in order to ensure its long-term success.</p>
<p>This decision was not made lightly, and the casino is aware of the inconvenience that it is causing its customers. However, the casino feels that it is better to take this step now rather than face even greater problems down the road.</p>
<p>It should be noted that this suspension does not mean that Casino is going out of business. The goal is to reevaluate the casino’s operations so that it can continue to provide a quality experience for its customers.</p>
<p>We appreciate your patience and understanding as we work through this issue.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Appeals-to-Gamblers-for-Help-in-order-to-Remain-Open"><a href="#Casino-Appeals-to-Gamblers-for-Help-in-order-to-Remain-Open" class="headerlink" title="Casino Appeals to Gamblers for Help in order to Remain Open"></a>Casino Appeals to Gamblers for Help in order to Remain Open</h1><p>A casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey is appealing to gamblers for help in order to remain open. The casino, which is owned by Caesars Entertainment, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January of 2019. In a recent court filing, the company said that it would need to raise $300 million by the end of June in order to stay afloat.</p>
<p>The casino is seeking permission to pay its creditors over the next six months. This would allow it to keep its doors open while it undergoes restructuring. The company said that it has reached an agreement with 90% of its lenders, but it still needs the approval of the US Bankruptcy Court in order to proceed.</p>
<p>Caesars Entertainment also owns several other casinos in Atlantic City, including Harrah’s Resort and Bally’s Casino Hotel. The company plans to sell some of its assets in order to raise money for the bankrupt casino. This includes its hotels and golf courses.</p>
<p>The Atlantic Club Casino Hotel first opened its doors in 1980. It has been through several previous owners, and was most recently purchased by Caesars Entertainment in 2013. The casino has struggled in recent years as gambling competition has increased from nearby states such as Pennsylvania and New York.</p>

This closure will result in the loss of over 300 jobs. </p>
<p>“This was not an easy decision, but it is necessary given the current state of the industry,” said a spokesperson for the casino. “We are committed to doing everything we can to help our employees during this difficult time.” </p>
<p>The closure is likely due to increased competition from casinos in other states, as well as the legalization of gambling in several more states in recent years. </p>
<p>Casino employees will receive severance packages and assistance finding new jobs.</p>

<p>For example, if you want to save the money, one option would be to open up a savings account and deposit the funds into that account. Alternatively, if you are looking for a more high-yield investment option, you could invest the money in a certificate of deposit (CD) or a mutual fund. Regardless of what you decide to do, it is important that you take some time to think about your options and make a decision that is right for you.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, while gambling can be fun and exciting, it is important to remember that there is always risk involved. So if you happen to hit it big while playing at a casino, make sure that you take some time to think about what you want to do with the money before heading off on any shopping sprees.</p>

        <h1 id="Bill-Gates-Announces-Plans-to-Ban-Casino-Ads-on-Facebook"><a href="#Bill-Gates-Announces-Plans-to-Ban-Casino-Ads-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Bill Gates Announces Plans to Ban Casino Ads on Facebook"></a>Bill Gates Announces Plans to Ban Casino Ads on Facebook</h1><p>In a recent blog post, Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates announced his plans to ban casino advertisements on Facebook.</p>
<p>“Casinos are a predatory industry that targets the most vulnerable members of society,” Gates wrote. “They prey on people’s hopes and dreams, and ruin lives in the process. I believe that we need to do everything we can to protect our citizens from their influence.”</p>
<p>Gates has been a longtime critic of the casino industry, and he has previously called for tighter regulation of casinos. In his blog post, Gates said that he is hopeful that by banning casino ads on Facebook, it will help reduce the number of people who are exposed to their “destructive influence.”</p>
<p>Facebook has been under pressure to crack down on casino advertising in recent years. A number of advocacy groups have argued that casino ads can be addictive and harmful to vulnerable populations, such as young people and problem gamblers.</p>
<p>In a statement, a Facebook spokesperson said that the company is “committed to preventing illegal gambling activity on our platform.” The spokesperson added that the company is currently working on implementing new policies to prohibit casino ads from being shown to minors and problem gamblers.</p>
<h1 id="Bill-Gates-Tackles-the-Issue-of-Gambling-Ads-on-Facebook"><a href="#Bill-Gates-Tackles-the-Issue-of-Gambling-Ads-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Bill Gates Tackles the Issue of Gambling Ads on Facebook"></a>Bill Gates Tackles the Issue of Gambling Ads on Facebook</h1><h1 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>In a recent blog post, Bill Gates tackles the issue of gambling ads on Facebook. Gates points out that Facebook has been under pressure to address the issue of gambling addiction, and he applauds the company for taking steps to address the problem. However, Gates also criticizes Facebook for allowing gambling ads on its platform.</p>
<p>Gates notes that there is a strong link between problem gambling and suicide, and he argues that Facebook should do more to protect vulnerable people from these ads. He points out that Facebook has taken some steps to limit the visibility of these ads, but he believes that more can be done.</p>
<p>Gates also argues that Facebook should take a stronger stance against illegal gambling operations. He notes that these operations often prey on vulnerable people, and he believes that Facebook has a responsibility to take action against them.</p>
<p>Overall, Gates believes that Facebook can do more to protect people from the dangers of gambling addiction. He urges the company to take a proactive approach to this problem, and he hopes that it will make changes in the future.</p>
<h1 id="Bill-Gates-Wants-to-End-Casino-Ads-on-Facebook"><a href="#Bill-Gates-Wants-to-End-Casino-Ads-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Bill Gates Wants to End Casino Ads on Facebook"></a>Bill Gates Wants to End Casino Ads on Facebook</h1><p>Bill Gates is no stranger to advocating for social change. The world’s second-richest person has spoken out about climate change, gun reform, and now, the need to end casino advertising on Facebook.</p>
<p>In an interview with The New York Times, Gates expressed concern that casino ads are targeting vulnerable populations, specifically young people. He believes that if Facebook were to ban all casino advertising, it would be a major step in preventing problem gambling among its users.</p>
<p>Problem gambling is a serious issue; according to the National Council on Problem Gambling, it affects almost 2% of American adults. Problem gamblers are at risk for developing a number of negative consequences, including financial instability, relationship problems, and even suicide.</p>
<p>Banning casino advertising on Facebook could help reduce the number of people who develop a problem with gambling. It would also be in line with the company’s recently announced goal of promoting “healthy digital communities.” In a statement announcing this goal, Facebook said it would “prioritize meaningful social interactions over passive consumption.” By banning casino ads, Facebook can make good on this commitment while also protecting its users from harm.</p>
<p>It’s not yet clear whether or not Facebook will actually ban casino ads. However, Gates’ comments are sure to raise awareness about the issue and put pressure on the company to take action. If you agree that Facebook should ban casino ads, share this article on social media and let your friends know what you think!</p>
<h1 id="Gates-Proposes-Banning-Casino-Ads-on-Facebook"><a href="#Gates-Proposes-Banning-Casino-Ads-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Gates Proposes Banning Casino Ads on Facebook"></a>Gates Proposes Banning Casino Ads on Facebook</h1><p>In a recent interview with The New York Times, Bill Gates proposed banning casino advertisements on Facebook. He believes that such ads can lead to addiction and ruin people’s lives.</p>
<p>“The social media companies need to be restrictive about the types of ads they allow,” Gates told NYT. “They shouldn’t allow casino advertising.”</p>
<p>Casino advertising is currently allowed on Facebook, as well as other social media platforms. However, Gates believes that it’s time for this type of advertising to be banned. He points to the fact that casino addiction can ruin people’s lives, both financially and emotionally.</p>
<p>“There’s no question that for many people gambling is an addiction,” Gates said. “It can destroy families and it’s not good for society.”</p>
<p>Gates’ proposal has already generated a lot of buzz online, with many people supporting it. Some believe that banning casino advertising on social media will help protect vulnerable populations from developing an addiction to gambling. Others believe that it’s simply a bad idea, as it will limit freedom of speech and deprive casinos of an important marketing tool.</p>
<p>No matter what side of the debate you’re on, it’s clear that Gates’ proposal has sparked a lot of discussion about the role of casino advertising on social media.</p>
<h1 id="Bill-Gates-Calls-for-End-to-Casino-Advertising-on-Facebook"><a href="#Bill-Gates-Calls-for-End-to-Casino-Advertising-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Bill Gates Calls for End to Casino Advertising on Facebook"></a>Bill Gates Calls for End to Casino Advertising on Facebook</h1><p>Bill Gates, the billionaire philanthropist, has urged Facebook to end advertising for casinos on its social media platform. The call comes as part of a renewed effort by Gates and other investors in the early childhood education sector to reduce gambling-related harm.</p>
<p>“It really bothers me that Facebook is allowing ads for casinos,” Gates said in an interview with The Washington Post. “It’s not good for society. Gambling should be about entertainment, not addiction.”</p>
<p>Gates joins a growing chorus of voices calling for an end to casino advertising on social media platforms. In February, a group of investors led by the parent company of the Boston Celtics called on Facebook to ban such ads . And in May, the U.K. Parliament’s Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee released a report calling for social media companies to stop targeting users with gambling ads.</p>
<p>Facebook has been under increasing pressure to address the issue of gambling addiction online. According to recent reports, the number of people seeking treatment for gambling-related problems has quadrupled in recent years . A study published last year by the University of Pittsburgh found that exposure to gambling ads on social media leads young people to take greater risks with their own money .</p>
<p>In a statement, Facebook said it takes its responsibility seriously when it comes to protecting people from harm, including problem gambling. The company said it is currently reviewing its policies around casino advertising “to ensure they are effective in protecting people.”</p>
<p>But Gates and other investors say that more needs to be done, and they are urging Facebook to go beyond simply reviewing its policies. They want the company to ban all advertising for casinos on its platform — not just those that promote problem gambling.</p>
<p>Experts say that such a ban would be a powerful tool in helping reduce the harms associated with casino gambling. “Banning casino advertising altogether is actually one of the most effective things Facebook could do to protect users from problem gambling ,” said Dr. Henryorters , director of research at Responsibility in Gambling Trust , a British charity dedicated to reducing gambling-related harm.

<p>Ray Hair, CEO of Microgaming, commented on the launch of SpinPlay: “We’re thrilled to announce the launch of our new SpinPlay solution. Our goal is to provide our players with the most enjoyable and flexible casino experience possible, and this new system does just that. We can’t wait for our players to start enjoying it!”</p>
