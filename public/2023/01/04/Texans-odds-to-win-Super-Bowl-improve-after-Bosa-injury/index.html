        <h1 id="Texans-odds-to-win-Super-Bowl-improve-after-Bosa-injury"><a href="#Texans-odds-to-win-Super-Bowl-improve-after-Bosa-injury" class="headerlink" title="Texans odds to win Super Bowl improve after Bosa injury"></a>Texans odds to win Super Bowl improve after Bosa injury</h1><p>The Houston Texans Super Bowl odds have improved after the injury to San Diego Chargers defensive end Joey Bosa.</p>
<p>The news of the Chargers’ first-round pick being out for an indefinite amount of time has sent the Texans’ odds from +4,000 all the way down to +1,600, making them the sixth favorite team to win the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>Houston was already a popular pick to make it to the big game this year, and with Bosa now out of the equation, they are looking even more likely to take home the Lombardi Trophy.</p>
<p>Some other interesting Super Bowl odds changes include the Minnesota Vikings jumping up from +10,000 to +7,500 after their impressive win over the Carolina Panthers on Sunday and the New England Patriots dropping from -150 to -180 after their Week 1 loss to Arizona.</p>
<h1 id="Houston-Texans-huge-favorites-against-the-Buffalo-Bills"><a href="#Houston-Texans-huge-favorites-against-the-Buffalo-Bills" class="headerlink" title="Houston Texans huge favorites against the Buffalo Bills"></a>Houston Texans huge favorites against the Buffalo Bills</h1><p>The Houston Texans come into their Week 5 matchup against the Buffalo Bills as huge favorites. The Texans have looked like one of the best teams in the NFL this season, while the Bills have been one of the worst.</p>
<p>Houston has a high-powered offense led by Deshaun Watson and DeAndre Hopkins. Watson has been spectacular this season, throwing for 1,366 yards and 15 touchdowns. Hopkins has been his favorite target, catching 34 passes for 478 yards and five touchdowns. The Bills will have a tough time stopping that duo on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Bills’ offense has been one of the worst in the NFL this season. They are last in points scored per game (10.8) and last in total yards (272.8). Josh Allen has struggled mightily at quarterback, completing just 50 percent of his passes for 753 yards, two touchdowns and four interceptions. He will need to play much better if the Bills want to have any chance of winning on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Texans should win this game easily. They are a far better team than the Bills and should be able to take advantage of their weaknesses. Look for Watson and Hopkins to have a big day against Buffalo’s defense, leading Houston to a comfortable victory.</p>
<h1 id="Las-Vegas-still-loves-the-Houston-Texans"><a href="#Las-Vegas-still-loves-the-Houston-Texans" class="headerlink" title="Las Vegas still loves the Houston Texans"></a>Las Vegas still loves the Houston Texans</h1><p>The Houston Texans are one of the up and coming teams in the NFL, but they have had a difficult time in Las Vegas. The Texans are 0-5 against the spread in their last five visits to Sin City.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that the oddsmakers have not given up on them, as they still have a respectable betting line. The current odds for the game has the Texans as 3-point underdogs, which is a testament to their potential.</p>
<p>Houston is a young and talented team, led by quarterback Deshaun Watson. They are coming off of a disappointing loss to the New York Giants, but they will be looking to bounce back this week.</p>
<p>The Raiders may be at home, but they are not playing well at all. They have lost their last three games against the spread and four of their last five overall.</p>
<p>This should be a close game, but I expect the Texans to come out on top. They are looking to prove themselves and I think they will do just that on Sunday.</p>
<h1 id="NFL-Week-3-Betting-trends-and-beyond"><a href="#NFL-Week-3-Betting-trends-and-beyond" class="headerlink" title="NFL Week 3: Betting trends and beyond"></a>NFL Week 3: Betting trends and beyond</h1><p>The NFL is now into its third week of action and there have been some surprising results. The Los Angeles Rams, who many people picked to represent the NFC in the Super Bowl, are 0-2 after losing to the Washington Redskins and the Oakland Raiders. The Philadelphia Eagles, on the other hand, are 2-0 after dismantling the Atlanta Falcons and the Carolina Panthers.</p>
<p>In this article, we will take a look at some of the betting trends from Week 3 and give our thoughts on which games to bet on.</p>
<p>The New England Patriots continue to be one of the most popular teams to bet on and they opened as 7-point favorites over the Houston Texans this week. However, the line has moved to 8.5 points at most sportsbooks as more money has come in on New England. The Patriots started slowly against the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 2 but were able to pull away in the second half for a convincing 31-20 victory. They will be looking for another strong performance against Houston this week.</p>
<p>The Dallas Cowboys are also surprisingly popular bets this week as they are 2.5-point favorites over the Arizona Cardinals. Rookie quarterback Dak Prescott has looked impressive in his first two starts and many people are picking Dallas to win their first game of the season.</p>
<p>The Buffalo Bills are another team that is getting a lot of attention from bettors this week as they are 2.5-point underdogs against the Denver Broncos. The Broncos started off the season with a victory over Carolina but were blown out by Atlanta last week. Buffalo is coming off a victory over Miami and they will be looking to pull off another upset this week.</p>
<p>Finally, we have the Detroit Lions who are 3-point underdogs against Green Bay this week. The Packers looked dominant in their first two games but they could be without starting quarterback Aaron Rodgers this week due to a hamstring injury. Detroit has struggled early on but they could be worth a small bet in this spot if Rodgers is unable to play for Green Bay.</p>
<h1 id="Overshadowed-again-Why-the-Texans-will-beat-Jacksonville"><a href="#Overshadowed-again-Why-the-Texans-will-beat-Jacksonville" class="headerlink" title="Overshadowed again: Why the Texans will beat Jacksonville"></a>Overshadowed again: Why the Texans will beat Jacksonville</h1><p>The Texans travel to Jacksonville to take on the Jaguars this weekend. This game is a critical one for both teams as they battle for playoff positioning, with the Texans currently in first place in the AFC South and the Jaguars in second.</p>
<p>Houston has been one of the most dominant teams in the NFL this season, with a record of 8-3. They have shown their ability to win in a variety of ways, with both a powerhouse offense and a stingy defense. The Jaguars have also been impressive this year, with a record of 7-4. However, they have not faced many tough opponents, with only two games against teams with winning records (the Patriots and Cowboys).</p>
<p>The Texans should be able to win this game as they are simply the better team. Jacksonville’s best player, rookie running back Leonard Fournette, is nursing an ankle injury and is unlikely to play. Without Fournette, the Jaguars’ offense will struggle, giving the Texans’ defense an advantage. Additionally, quarterback Blake Bortles has not been very good this year and is prone to making mistakes. The Texans should be able to take advantage of this and win comfortably.</p>
<p>While it is always difficult to predict games in the NFL, it is hard to see how Jacksonville can beat Houston in their current state. The Texans are coming off a bye week and are well rested, while the Jaguars just played on Thursday night. This game should be one-sided in favor of the Texans, who will come away victorious once again.</p>
