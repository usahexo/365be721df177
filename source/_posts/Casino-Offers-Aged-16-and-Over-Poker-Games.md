#  Casino Offers Aged 16 and Over Poker Games

The casino industry is competitive, so the various venues offer a range of games and services to attract players. The poker games are one attraction that casinos use to draw in customers. The poker games offered at casinos are typically for people who are aged 18 or older. However, there are a growing number of casinos that are now offering poker games for people who are aged 16 and over.

There are a number of benefits that come with playing poker at a casino that is geared towards people who are 16 and over. One advantage is that the atmosphere tends to be more relaxed than in casinos that only offer games for people who are 18 or older. This can make it easier for new players to learn the game and feel comfortable playing.

Another benefit of playing poker at a casino that is aimed at those aged 16 and over is that the dealers tend to be more experienced and patient. This can help ensure that players have a positive experience while playing, regardless of their skill level. Additionally, the dealers may be more likely to help players with strategies and give them tips on how to improve their gameplay.

There are also some drawbacks to playing poker in a casino that caters to those aged 16 and over. One potential downside is that there may not be as many tables available as in other casinos. This could lead to longer wait times to get a seat at a table. Additionally, the stakes may be lower in these casinos, which could mean less money can be won or lost while playing.

Despite these potential drawbacks, there are many benefits to playing poker at a casino aimed at those aged 16 and over. With more relaxed atmospheres and experienced dealers, these venues provide an enjoyable experience for all levels of players.

#  casino Introduces New Age Limit For Poker 

The casino has announced that it will no longer allow people under the age of 21 to play poker in its establishment. The change is set to take effect on July 1st, 2019. 

This announcement comes in the wake of the casino's recent decision to ban minors from all forms of gambling. In a statement released by the casino, it said that it made this change "in order to provide a safe and enjoyable environment for all of our guests." 

According to the casino, research has shown that people under the age of 21 are not developmentally ready to make sound decisions when it comes to gambling. This is especially true when it comes to poker, where players can lose large sums of money in a short amount of time. 

The casino added that it hopes this change will help protect vulnerable people from financial and emotional harm. It also said that it plans to work with local authorities and social services in order to help affected individuals.
