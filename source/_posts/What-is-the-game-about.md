#  What is the game about?

"The Witness" is an open-world puzzle video game developed by Thekla, Inc. and published by Jonathan Blow. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on January 26, 2016.

The player takes the role of a character who wakes up on an island with no idea who they are or how they got there. The island is littered with monuments and structures that hint at a larger mystery. The objective of the game is to explore the island, find clues to what happened to the player character's past and uncover the island's secrets.

# How does it play?

The gameplay of "The Witness" is based around solving puzzles. Many of the puzzles are based around drawing lines on panels in specific ways to create a designated pattern. There are also sequence puzzles that require the player to complete a series of panels in order. Other challenges include maze puzzles, perspective puzzles and sound puzzles.

The game features over 650 puzzles in total, which gradually increase in difficulty as the player progresses through the game. There are no tutorials or hints provided other than what is written on the panels themselves, so players must work out how to solve each puzzle through experimentation. "The Witness" features an asynchronous multiplayer mode where players can share their solutions to certain puzzles with other players.

# What are people saying about it?

"The Witness" has been met with critical acclaim from reviewers upon release. It has been praised for its unique puzzle design, its open-world exploration and its atmospheric art style. It has been nominated for several Game of the Year awards, including nominations from IGN, Game Informer and Destructoid. It won "Best Game Design" at The Game Awards 2016.

#  What are the features of the game?

  The game is intended for two to four players and takes about half an hour to play. Players can choose from 19 different characters, each with their own set of moves and abilities. There are also over 60 items that players can collect to help them in their quest.

The objective of the game is to take down the other players’ health points to zero, either by attacking them directly or by using the environment around you to your advantage. Be sure to keep an eye on your health points as well, as they will decrease over time if you don’t take any action.

The game features a unique art style that will appeal to gamers and non-gamers alike. The controls are easy to learn, but difficult to master, which ensures that everyone has a chance of winning the game.

#  What devices is it compatible with?

The Bose SoundLink Mini is a small and compact Bluetooth speaker that is compatible with a wide range of devices. It can be used with smartphones, tablets, laptops, and other Bluetooth-enabled devices.

The Bose SoundLink Mini has an NFC tag that allows users to quickly and easily connect their device by simply tapping it against the speaker. The speaker also has a built-in microphone that can be used for hands-free calling.

# How does it sound?

The Bose SoundLink Mini produces very good sound quality for its small size. The bass is nice and punchy, and the overall sound is clear and crisp. The speaker can get quite loud, making it perfect for parties or gatherings.

# Is it durable?

The Bose SoundLink Mini is made from high-quality materials that make it very durable. It can withstand bumps and scratches, and it is water resistant so you can safely use it in wet environments.

#  How do I play?

## Basics

In order to play a game of chess, you will need two players and a chess board. The chess board is made up of 64 squares - eight rows and eight columns. The squares are alternately coloured black and white. Each player has 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns.

The Board and Pieces

The board is placed so that the black square in the lower right-hand corner is closest to the player with the black pieces (therefore, the white square in the lower right-hand corner is closest to the player with the white pieces). The pieces are placed on the squares according to the following rules:


##Moving Pieces
Pieces can only be moved if they have a legal move available. A piece can move to any square that is directly adjacent to it (including diagonally), as long as there are no pieces blocking its way. A piece can only move one square at a time - it cannot jump over other pieces.


If a piece can make a move but has no legal moves available, then it is said to be blocked. If all of a player's pieces are blocked, then that player cannot make any more moves and must forfeit the game.


##Capture
When a piece captures an opponent's piece, it removes that piece from the board and takes its place. A capture can only be made if there is an empty square adjacent to the captured piece that is within the same file (row) as the captured piece. For example, a rook can capture an opponent's pawn because there is an empty square adjacent to it on either side. However, a bishop cannot capture an opponent's pawn because there are no empty squares adjacent to it on either side.
