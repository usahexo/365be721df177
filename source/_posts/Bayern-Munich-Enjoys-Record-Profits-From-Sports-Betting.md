#  Bayern Munich Enjoys Record Profits From Sports Betting

In an announcement released by the club, Bayern Munich has reported record profits from sports betting in its 2017/2018 fiscal year. The Bundesliga powerhouse attributed the increase to a new sponsorship deal with sports betting company Bwin.

“The new partnership enables us to offer our fans an even wider range of betting opportunities and services around the clock on all major football tournaments and games as well as other sports,” said Bayern Munich CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge in a statement.

The five-year deal is reportedly worth €110 million (US$127 million). In addition to jersey branding, Bayern Munich’s training ground will bear the Bwin name. The online gaming company will also enjoy exclusive rights to digital marketing of the club’s 24 official websites in 10 different languages.

Bayern Munich posted a profit before taxes of €176 million (US$202 million) for the 2017/2018 fiscal year, up from €159 million (US$183 million) the previous year. With total revenue reaching €619 million (US$710 million), the club remains Germany’s most profitable sports organization.

Bwin already has partnerships with other top European clubs such as Real Madrid, Juventus, and AC Milan. The deal is seen as a major win for Bwin as it looks to expand its footprint in the lucrative German market.

#  Betting On Sports Adds Excitement And Fun To The Game!

Do you enjoy watching sports? If you do, then you're probably like millions of other people who also enjoy betting on sports. In fact, betting on sports is one of the most popular forms of gambling in the world.

There are a number of reasons why betting on sports is so popular. For starters, it adds excitement and excitement to the game. Secondly, it's a way to make the game more interesting to watch. And thirdly, it can be a lot of fun to bet on your favorite team and see how well they do.

One thing that's important to keep in mind if you're going to bet on sports is to make sure that you do so responsibly. Don't bet more than you can afford to lose and always be sure to gamble with money that you can afford to lose. Gambling should be fun and if you start losing money, it's no longer fun. So be smart about how much money you wager on each game.

If you're new to betting on sports, there are a few things that you need to know before getting started. The first thing is that not all sporting events are covered by bets. The second thing is that there are different types of bets that can be placed. And the third thing is that there are different ways to place bets - through a bookmaker or online casino, for example.

Once you understand the basics of how betting on sports works, you can start looking into the different types of bets that are available. There are three main types of bets: heads-up or single bet; accumulators or multiples; and reverses or combination bets.

The most common type of bet is the single bet, where two opponents face off against each other and a wager is placed on who will win. Accumulator bets involve making several selections and combining them into one wager in order to win bigger payouts from smaller stakes. Reverses are a type of combination bet which allow punters to combine two selections into one single bet with two possible outcomes - either both teams winning or both teams losing - for bigger payouts than would normally be available from just betting on either outcome separately.

Once you've got a good understanding of the different types of bets available, it's time to start looking at some specific examples so that you can get an idea for how they work. Here are three examples:

1) Manchester United vs Chelsea - A single bet could be placed on who will win this match - Manchester United or Chelsea?
2) Manchester United vs Chelsea - An accumulator bet could be made involving three matches - Manchester United vs Chelsea, Liverpool vs Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal vs Newcastle United - with each selection being placed as a separate accumulator bet." 
3) Manchester united vs Chelsea - A reverse could be placed involving these same two sides where the punter risks £10 in order to win £100 if Chelsea loses but Manchester united wins (or vice versa).

#  NJ Casino's Benefit From Sports Betting Too!

A recent report on the economic benefits of sports betting commissioned by the New Jersey Legislature finds that casinos in Atlantic City and beyond will also benefit from legalized sports betting.

The conclusions of the report, conducted by Econsult Solutions, are that legalizing sports betting in New Jersey would create thousands of jobs and produce millions of dollars in tax revenue. "Not only is the legalization of sports betting likely to produce a new and substantial revenue stream for the state, but it is also likely to create a large number of jobs," said Dr. Gerald Master, one of the authors of the report.

The study also found that expansion of legal sports betting to other states would have even greater benefits. "If sports betting is legalized elsewhere in the country, much of that business will come our way as New Jerseyans take their gambling dollar with them on trips to other states," said Master.

#  Sports Betting Fuels The Economy In Jersey!

The state of New Jersey could be in for a big financial windfall, now that its Supreme Court has cleared the way for legalized sports betting!

Governor Phil Murphy has already announced plans to ensure that the Garden State reaps the benefits of this new industry, vowing to make it “the most regulated and litigated market in the country.”

Murphy is expecting at least $13 million in tax revenue from sports betting in its first year alone, and believes that this could grow to as much as $300 million per year.

This money is desperately needed in a state that has long been struggling financially. It is estimated that New Jersey has a $14 billion budget shortfall, and the legalization of sports betting will go a long way towards alleviating this problem.

So why is sports betting so important to the economy of New Jersey?

Simply put, it is a huge generator of tax revenue. In addition to the taxes that Murphy expects to collect from sports betting, there are also taxes on casino gambling and on horseracing. Taken together, these taxes account for about 6 percent of New Jersey’s total tax revenue.

But it’s not just about the money. The legalization of sports betting will also create jobs in New Jersey. In fact, Murphy has already announced his intention to establish a Sports Wagering Commission that will have the task of regulating the industry. This commission will need staff to carry out its duties, and so should provide an influx of jobs for residents of New Jersey.

Finally, there are all sorts of ancillary businesses that will benefit from the legalization of sports betting. For example, there will be a need for companies that provide online gambling services, as well as companies that supply software and other technology to casinos and other gaming establishments. All told, it is safe to say that the legalization of sports betting will be a boon to the economy of New Jersey!

#  People In NJ Benefit Largely From Sports Betting!

It is no secret that the people of New Jersey enjoy a good wager, but a new report from the state’s Division of Gaming Enforcement shows just how much they benefit from legalized sports betting.

The report, which was released last week, indicates that sports betting in the state generated $385 million in gaming revenue during 2018. This mirrors the amount wagered by bettors, as well as the tax revenue generated by the industry.

What’s more, it is estimated that over $100 million of this total will be returned to casino and racetrack operators in the form of commissions and other payments. In addition, another $72 million will go to taxpayers in the form of income and other taxes.

This is great news for New Jersey, which has seen its gambling industry rebound since sports betting was legalized in 2018. It also underscores the importance of keeping sports betting legal, as this type of gaming activity contributes significantly to the state’s economy.
