#  California Casino Finally Offers A Way To Keep Your Winnings!

A California casino is now offering a way to keep your winnings without having to worry about taxation.

The casino, which is unnamed for security reasons, has announced a plan that will allow players to keep their winnings tax-free. In order to take advantage of the offer, players must first complete a brief survey on the casino's website.

Once the survey is complete, players will be given a unique code that can be used at the casino's cashier to redeem their winnings. The code can only be used once and it is valid for 24 hours.

This new promotion comes as a welcome relief to many in light of recent changes to the US tax code. The new tax law, which was signed by President Trump in December 2017, imposes a heavy tax burden on winnings from gambling and other high-income activities.

Under the new law, taxes on gambling winnings are now taxed as regular income. This means that taxpayers will have to pay federal taxes as well as state and local taxes on any money they win from casinos or other gambling activities.

The new law applies to all forms of gambling, including online poker, blackjack, and roulette. It also applies to lotteries and even slot machines at race tracks.

The tax burden can be quite substantial for high-income taxpayers. For example, someone who wins $10,000 playing poker would now have to pay over $3,000 in taxes. This represents a 30% tax rate on gambling income!

The new law has generated a lot of controversy since it was signed into effect last year. Some people argue that it is unfair to tax gambling income while others argue that the taxes are necessary to help offset the costs of harmful gambling addiction.

Regardless of where you stand on the issue of taxation, there is no doubt that the new law has created a lot of confusion among gamblers across the country. This latest promotion from the California casino offers a way for players to bypass these new taxes and keep their hard-earned money!
