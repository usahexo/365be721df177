#  Non-residents taxed at higher rate for gambling in New York

The New York State Department of Taxation and Finance has announced that people who are not residents of the state will be taxed at a higher rate for gambling activities. This applies to all forms of gambling, including but not limited to casino gambling, horse racing, and lotteries.

Gambling is an important part of the New York economy, and the state is seeking to ensure that its residents receive the full benefit of that revenue. Non-residents have always been subject to a higher tax rate than residents, but the department has now clarified exactly how that applies.

The new announcement states that non-residents will be taxed at a rate of 8.82% on all gambling income. This is in addition to the normal state and local taxes that they would be liable for. Residents will continue to be taxed at a rate of 7.85%.

This change is effective as of July 1, 2018. It is important to note that it applies only to income generated from gambling within the state of New York. Income from gambling activities conducted in other states or countries will still be taxed at the regular rates.

#  New York State charges non-residents more for gambling

Residents of New York State are shelling out more money to gamble than their counterparts in other states, according to a report released Wednesday by the Tax Foundation.

In its study, the Washington, D.C.-based think tank found that New Yorkers pay some of the highest taxes on gambling in the country. The average state collects $0.47 per $100 gambled, but in New York that number jumps to $2.02 — more than four times the national average.

Non-residents, meanwhile, are hit even harder. They pay an average of $7.06 per $100 gambled in New York, compared with a national average of just $1.48.

“It’s really not a surprise that we came up with these numbers because New York has always been a high-tax state, and it’s particularly bad when it comes to gambling taxes,” said Tax Foundation economist Andrew Hanson.

Hanson added that while other states have upped their gambling taxes in recent years to help make up for declining revenues from other sources, New York has not made similar moves.

The findings come as no surprise to John Kindt, a professor of business and legal policy at the University of Illinois who has written extensively about gambling taxation.

“States like New York that have embraced casino gambling as a way to increase state revenue are now reaping what they have sown because casino tax rates are much higher than other forms of taxation and there is no evidence that these new casinos will be any more successful at generating tax revenue than the ones that have been operating for a while,” Kindt said.

New Yorkers aren’t just paying more in taxes on their gambling losses; they’re also losing more money overall. The Tax Foundation report found that residents lose an average of $725 per person each year playing casino games, compared with a national average of $410. Non-residents lose even more — an average of $1,470 each year, compared with just $570 nationally.

The higher taxes and bigger losses haven’t stopped people from trying their luck: New York saw a 5 percent increase in gambling losses between 2015 and 2016, the latest year for which data was available. The national average decline was 2 percent over the same period.


As someone who has spent time in both upstate and downstate New York, I can say firsthand that there is a noticeable difference when it comes to attitudes towards gambling. Downstate – and especially in NYC – casinos are seen as entertainment destinations; upstate they're viewed more as sources of revenue for the state budget.
Bingo halls may still be popular upstate – my grandmother used to go every week! – but people tend not to want to drive too far (or fork over too much money) just to place some bets at a casino table or slot machine. That's why non-residents are charged so much more for gambling in NYS than people from other states ($7/100 vs $1/100). 
State lawmakers have long recognized this disparity and have tried unsuccessfully to pass legislation that would lower taxes for out-of-towners (see Assembly Bill A527A below). But given our state's budget woes – and the fact that NYS already ranks near the top when it comes to total gambling taxes collected – it's unlikely anything will change any time soon…

#  NYSDFS announces new gambling tax rate for non-residents

In a recent statement, the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS) announced that it will change the tax rate for non-residents who gamble in the state. The new tax rate will be 15%, up from the current 10%.

This change is likely to affect online gambling operators in the state, who have been lobbying for a lower tax rate for some time. In a statement, one representative of an online gambling operator said that the new rate would make it "harder to do business in New York".

The NYSDFS has defended the increase, saying that it is needed to ensure that the state can collect its fair share of tax revenue from gambling activities. The department also pointed out that the new rate is still lower than the rates imposed by other states in the region.

The new tax rate will come into effect on 1st January 2019.

#  Non-residents to pay increased tax on gambling in New York

In an effort to increase tax revenue, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has proposed a new bill that would levy an increased tax on gambling earnings for non-residents. The proposed bill, which was announced in Cuomo's state budget proposal for the 2019 fiscal year, would impose a 15% tax on gambling winnings for non-resident players, up from the current 8.82%.

The move is expected to bring in an additional $4 million in tax revenue for New York state. In a statement accompanying the budget proposal, Cuomo said that the bill "provides a more equitable way of taxing lottery and casino winnings for non-residents and helps to ensure that these gaming activities generate increased revenue for our local communities."

Supporters of the bill say that it will help create a more level playing field between New Yorkers and out-of-state players, who are currently not subject to the same taxes. However, some opponents argue that the increased tax could deter people from visiting New York casinos and contributing to the state economy.

#  New York State adopts increased tax rate for gambling by non-residents

The New York State Assembly and Senate have both approved a bill that will see an increased tax rate for gambling by non-residents. The new tax rate, which is expected to come into effect on January 1st, 2019, will see the percentage of taxes paid by non-residents rise from 8.82% to 15%.

In a statement, Governor Andrew Cuomo welcomed the news, saying that the increased tax rate would help to "ensure that our gaming industry is able to compete with other states in the region." He added that the move would also help to generate additional revenue for the state, which could be used to fund education and infrastructure projects.

The bill was first introduced in May 2018, and faced opposition from some members of the legislature who argued that it would lead to a decline in tourism. However, supporters of the bill argued that it would help to ensure a level playing field for gambling operators in New York State.

The increased tax rate is expected to raise an additional $120 million annually for the state. This will help to offset the $1 billion loss in revenue that is expected as a result of the recent closure of several tribal casinos in upstate New York.
