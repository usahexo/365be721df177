Non-progressive port machine Platon outperforms competition according to recent study!

Researchers at the University of Tokyo have released a study in which they compare the performance of non-progressive port machines Platon and P1. Surprisingly, Platon outperforms P1 by a significant margin.

The researchers conducted experiments using two different models: a 3D printer and a milling machine. In both cases, Platon proved to be faster and more accurate than P1.

According to the study, the main reason for Platon’s superior performance is its ability to optimize and parallelize the port movements. This allows it to achieve greater speeds and accuracy than P1.

Platon has been available to commercial users since early 2018, and it is already clear that it is the best non-progressive port machine on the market.
