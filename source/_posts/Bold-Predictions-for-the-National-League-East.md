#  Bold Predictions for the National League East

The National League East is always a hotly contested division, and the 2018 season should be no different. Here are 5 bold predictions for the teams in the NL East.

1. The Nationals will win the division.

Washington is the clear-cut favorite in the NL East, and they should cruise to their 4th consecutive division title. Led by MVP-candidate Bryce Harper and Cy Young candidate Max Scherzer, the Nationals are loaded with talent and should be a force to be reckoned with this season.

2. The Mets will finish in last place.

While the Mets made some big offseason acquisitions, they still have a lot of question marks heading into the year. With an aging roster and a bullpen that is filled with inexperienced pitchers, New York could very well finish in last place in the NL East this season.

3. The Braves will be one of the surprise teams of the year.

Atlanta has made some big strides over the past few years, and they should continue to improve in 2018. With young stars like Freddie Freeman and Ronald Acuna Jr., as well as a solid pitching staff, the Braves are poised for a breakout season this year.

4. The Phillies will struggle again this year.

Philadelphia has made some major investments over the past few years, but they have yet to show any signs of improvement on the field. With an aging roster and few standout players, the Phillies are likely to finish near the bottom of the standings once again this season.

5. The Marlins will be one of baseball's worst teams once again.


After dismantling their team prior to last season, Miami was one of baseball's worst teams in 2017. They haven't done much to improve their roster this offseason, so don't expect much from them in 2018 either

#  Can the Nationals Repeat as Division Champions?

The Washington Nationals surprised many people last year when they won the NL East division title. This season, can they repeat that success and make it back to the playoffs?

There’s no doubt that the Nationals boast an impressive lineup. Led by star players like Bryce Harper and Max Scherzer, Washington is certainly capable of scoring plenty of runs. Their pitching staff is also solid, with Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg leading the way.

However, there are some question marks surrounding this team. For one, their bullpen is relatively inexperienced and unproven. Additionally, the Nationals will have to contend with a very tough division rival in the New York Mets.

 Ultimately, I think the Nationals will fall just short of winning the division again this year. They should still be a playoff contender, but I expect the Mets to come out on top in the end.

#  Who Will Win the NL East This Year?

The NL East is always a hotly contested division and this year should be no different. In this article, we will take a look at the five teams in the division and try to determine who will come out on top.

The Philadelphia Phillies have made some big offseason moves, including signing free agent catcher J.T. Realmuto. They also added Bryce Harper and Andrew McCutchen to an already potent lineup. The Phillies are loaded and could be the team to beat in the NL East this year.

The Atlanta Braves had a very good season last year and should be even better in 2019. They added Josh Donaldson to their lineup and he should provide a boost to their offense. The Braves are young and exciting, and they could give the Phillies a run for their money this year.

The Washington Nationals were a disappointment last year, but they should be much better in 2019. They made some key additions in the offseason, including Patrick Corbin and Brian Dozier. The Nationals have one of the best pitching staffs in baseball and should once again be contenders for the division title.

The New York Mets had another disappointing season last year, but they could be on the rise in 2019. They made some key additions in the offseason, including Robinson Cano, Wilson Ramos, and Jed Lowrie. If these players can live up to their potential, the Mets could surprise everyone and make a run at the division title.

The Miami Marlins are rebuilding once again and are not expected to contend this year. However, stranger things have happened and they could surprise everyone by making a run at the division title.

In conclusion, it is hard to pick a clear favorite in the NL East this year. However, I think the Philadelphia Phillies have the most talent and will come out on top

#   Phillies on the Rise in 2018?

The Phillies are coming off a season in which they finished 71-91 and in fourth place in the NL East. With a young nucleus of players and offseason additions, they are looking to return to contender status in 2018.

The Phillies' lineup is anchored by first baseman Rhys Hoskins, who hit 18 home runs in his first 34 games after being called up from the minors last season. Third baseman Maikel Franco had a breakout 2017 season, with 24 home runs and 88 RBIs. Young outfielders Odubel Herrera and Aaron Altherr also provide power, with 20 and 19 home runs, respectively.

The Phillies made some key acquisitions this offseason to bolster their pitching staff. They signed free agent Jake Arrieta to a three-year, $75 million contract. Arrieta is a two-time Cy Young Award winner and was a crucial part of the Chicago Cubs' World Series championship team in 2016. The Phillies also acquired reliever Pat Neshek from the Colorado Rockies and starter Nick Pivetta from the Washington Nationals.

With this young talented core and some added firepower in the pitching staff, the Phillies are projected to finish second in the NL East division behind the Washington Nationals. Look for them to make a push for the playoffs late in the season and return to contender status after several years of rebuilding.

#   Braves Look to Make a Run at the Division Crown

The Braves have made a significant improvement over last season and currently sit in first place in the National League East.

This offseason, the Braves acquired some key players that have helped them compete this year. They signed Nick Markakis to a four-year deal and Andrelton Simmons to a seven-year contract. They also acquired Justin Upton from the Padres and Craig Kimbrel from the Red Sox.

These players have been key contributors to the team’s success so far this season. Upton is batting .287 with 12 homers and 42 RBIs, while Kimbrel has racked up 29 saves.

The Braves will need to continue to play well in order to stay ahead of teams like the Nationals and Mets in their division.
