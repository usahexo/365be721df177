Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft and one of the richest people in the world, is also a big fan of baccarat. In a recent interview, Gates said that he bets an average of $10,000 per session when he plays the game. 

Baccarat is a card game that is popular among high-rollers and celebrities. The object of the game is to draw cards with values as close to 9 as possible. Players can bet on either the player or banker hand, or they can bet on a tie. 

Gates says that he usually bets on the banker hand, but he will bet on the player hand if he thinks that hand has a good chance of winning. He also said that he will sometimes bet on a tie, but only if the odds are in his favor. 

Gates' biggest win at baccarat was $335,000, but he has also had some big losses. In fact, Gates has lost more money playing baccarat than he has won. But that doesn't seem to bother him.

#  Gates Tipped His Dealer $5,000 on the Last Hand He Played

It was a big night for Gates. The Microsoft mogul had just finished up a three-day poker marathon at the Bellagio in Las Vegas and had won nearly $3 million. He was feeling good. So good, in fact, that on his last hand of the night he decided to gamble everything he had left—$5,000—on a single hand of blackjack.

Gates lost the hand and walked away from the table a few thousand dollars poorer. But it didn't bother him. In fact, he later said it was one of the most fun things he's ever done. "I'm not a huge gambler, but I do like to take risks on occasion," Gates said in an interview after the game. "And this was definitely one of those times."

It's hard to blame Gates for wanting to have some fun on his final night in Vegas. After all, he had just pulled off one of the biggest poker wins in history. But some people were critical of Gates' decision to bet so much money on such a risky venture. "You have to be pretty reckless to lose your entire winnings from the previous three days in a single hand of blackjack," one observer said.

Others defended Gates, saying that it's perfectly reasonable for someone as successful as him to take a few risks every now and then. "Gates has enough money that even if he did lose all $5,000, it wouldn't make much of a dent in his bank account," one commentator said. "He can afford to take some chances and have some fun."

Whether you think Gates' decision was reckless or not, there's no denying that it made for an entertaining story. And that's something we can all appreciate regardless of our opinion on gambling.
